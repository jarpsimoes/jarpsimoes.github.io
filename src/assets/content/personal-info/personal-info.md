## About me 

I am a technology enthusiast, throughout my live was worked from old QBasic to newest GoLang, 
passed by main entreprise technologies such a **Java, NodeJS, Python, C++, etc.**


I've been worked as well, with most relevant environments as Applications Servers 
(**Tomcat, Wildfly, JBoss, Weblogic, Websphere AS**) and the most recent technologies as 
Containers (**Docker** and **Podman**) and with containers orchestration Openshift and 
Kubernetes on-prem and Kubernetes as service of cloud providers **Azure, AWS, GCP 
and Oracle Cloud.**


As an Architect, I was work with main paradigms such a monoliths, microservices 
and cloud native applications. I've a DevOps focus, really believe in Developments 
Teams with operations knowledge to allow development and operate yours code.


That vision it's big challenge, because it not easy had a development 
team with solid knowledge about environments. But that's my challenge, 
allow the teams to get knowledge and become an independent.


For me, the only deference between Java (or other development language) 
and Terraform or Ansible it's only syntax, each them it's a development language with 
different goals.

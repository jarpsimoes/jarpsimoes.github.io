## About me 

I am a technology enthusiast, throughout my life I worked from old QBasic to newest GoLang, 
passing by main enterprise technologies such as **Java, NodeJS, Python, C++, etc.**


I worked as well, with the most relevant environments as Applications Servers 
(**Tomcat, Wildfly, JBoss, Weblogic, Websphere AS**) and the most recent technologies as 
Containers (**Docker** and **Podman**) and with containers orchestration Openshift and 
Kubernetes on-prem and Kubernetes as service of cloud providers **Azure, AWS, GCP 
and Oracle Cloud.**


As Architect, I worked with main paradigms such a monoliths, microservices 
and cloud native applications. I've a DevOps focus, really believe in Developments 
Teams with operations knowledge to allow their development and operate yours code.


This vision it's big challenge, because it not easy to have a development 
team with solid knowledge about environments. But that's my challenge, 
allow the teams to get knowledge and become independent.


For me, the only difference between Java (or other development language) 
and Terraform or Ansible it's only syntax, each of them it's a development language with 
different goals
